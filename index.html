        <h2>Rhoda Essien</h2>
        <p>Hiii, I'm Rhoda and I'm Ghanaian/Antiguan. I am 19 years old and have a passion for fixing situations with Technology
            For this reason I decided to get a Bachelors in Information Technology at the University Of the West Indies Mona.
            I am currently the President of the UWI Mona Circle K and also External Chairperson for the Antigua Barbuda 
            Student Association. In my freetime I enjoy watching football, Chelsea FC specifically and playing instruments.
            Having done a bit of html at Cape level, I wanted to better my skills. And for this I'm really interested in Web 
            Development, and I also need this course for my degree.
